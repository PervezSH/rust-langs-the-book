# Rust Langs: The Book

This repository contains a collection of code examples and explanations that I made while learning Rust programming language from scratch up to intermediate level.

This project aims at walking you through the various concepts of Rust programming language. 


## About the Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is designed to be memory-safe without sacrificing performance, making it ideal for systems-level programming. Rust is also a great language for web development, game development, and other applications that require high performance and reliability.
